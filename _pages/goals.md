> I am a firm believer in the phrase work hard play hard. So when I am not working to accomplish my academic/career goals, I am making the most of my time hanging out with friends, meeting new people, rock climbing, or picking up new hobbies. 

## Career
What’s the purpose of life if I am not doing something meaningful? This question has governed the way I view my career. I don’t want to live life on autopilot. I want to do something that matters. 

As of right now, I am interested in various fields like <b>software engineering, data science, trading, and entrepreneurship.</b> Although I do not know exactly what path I will take or how I will take such path, I will be sure to find hard problems worth solving along the way. Until then I hope to keep learning new skills to one day etch my impact in society. 

Throughout my career, I hope to surround myself by people willing to work hard, take risks, and innovate. I strongly believe in the saying that "you are the product of those you surround yourself with", so I hope that alongside those who want to do something meaningful I know I will continue to create something worth creating.

## Personal
I try my best to live by the saying "you only live once". For that reason, I am always pushing myself outside of my comfort zone to try new hobbies (many of which stick). I have many more specific goals, but overarchingly, I am continually working to improve my rock climbing, photography, fashion, and interpersonal skills.
