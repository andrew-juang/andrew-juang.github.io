Hello! My name is Andrew and I am currently pursuing a BA in Computer Science at Boston University. 

This is my personal website which I created to share my journey, passions, and insights into who I am. It is my hope that as you navigate through these pages, you will gain a deeper understanding of who I am as a personâ€”perhaps even find some sort of connection to me. I am always eager to talk to like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me about anything!
